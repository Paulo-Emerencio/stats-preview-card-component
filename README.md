## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't know how to turn the black and white image from the images folder into that purple duotone of the design, so I had the idea to create a purple pseudo element, place it over the image and use the multiply blending mode. When it worked I was so happy ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥³

```css
.bg-image {
    position: relative;

    width: 100%;
    height: calc(165px + 20vw);

    background-size: cover;
    background-position: bottom 10% center;
    background-image:
        var(--img-gradient),
        url(../images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
}
.bg-image::after {
    content: '';
    
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;

    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;

    background-color: var(--accent-color);
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

### Continued development

I had a hard time trying to use Sass in this challenge, so I gave in (for now) and just used pure CSS. I'll now focus in mastering Sass and will for sure use it in the next challenge.
